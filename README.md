The goal is to develop a new JIRA. Based upon the principles of the scaledagileframework.com. The reason is that in daily life JIRA is used a lot and is really great for just a team or a project, but when uses also for Portfolio / PI etc it becomes really expensive and very hard to work with.
So the pretention is set, the time is against it and the knowledge of certain tools also. That's why it's made opensource, so everybody can use it and can contribute.
